# Odoo Developers Project Manager

## Goal of the project
The main goal is - to create tool for developing on odoo platform, which will meet the following requirements:
- do not depend from operating system
- do not depend from process architecture if it is possible (For example you can start this project on MacOS on M1)
- еo transfer all project information, it is enough to have an `odpm.json` in project repository, and the system will be able to easily prepare a new environment in a fully automatic mode based on it.
- To have convenient tools that are often necessary for the developer, for example:
    - fast DB recovery from the archive
    - сreation of a new DB with its own settings (country, language, demo data, etc.)
    - Changing the login and password for the administrator
    - ... and more
    - mechanisms for extending the functionality, for the future

If you are new, i recommend using this project in conjunction with the training demo [`https://github.com/aayartsev/odoo_demo_project`](https://github.com/aayartsev/odoo_demo_project).

## Prepare
You need to download and install the following programs:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## How to start work

Create a folder where your new project will be located. At the end of the project name, I add the odoo version number through a hyphen. For example, `odoo_demo_project-17`. This is due to the fact that the difference between versions is quite significant and I consider the same modules for different versions as different projects for development, despite the fact that they can be in the same repository. Your project environment will be located in this directory in the future. You need to initiate a new one using the `--init` command option, where we can specify a link to the git repository(o link to local directory) and using the `--branch` option, we specify the specific branch we want to switch the project under development to:

Launch `VSCode` then threw menu File - Open Folder, open our folder `odoo_demo_project-17`.

Now we cat enable Terminal threw menu Terminal - New Terminal. Then in it you can input commands that are written below. If someone, looking at a python script, wants to run it inside a virtual environment, then do not do this. In this case, it is used instead of system scripting languages and you will only complicate your life. The virtual environment for the project will be installed inside the container.

At the very first launch of the previously described command:
```bash
python3 /path/to/cloned/odoo_dev_project/odpm.py --init git@github.com:aayartsev/odoo_demo_project.git --branch 17.0-test_odpm_json
```
If you do not wish to contact the `git` repository for any reason, you can easily create a local development environment by simply specifying a desired directory location.

```bash
python3 /path/to/cloned/odoo_dev_project/odpm.py --init file:///your/path/to/odoo_demo_project-17/name_of_development_directory
```

The system will try to prepare your computer:
1. The system will ask questions about which parameters should be saved to a file `.env`
1. If you are deploying a project from scratch, the system will ask you to specify the odoo version and make initial settings based on this information
1. The cloning process of the main odoo repository will be started. This takes a very significant time of 40 minutes or more, so be patient
1. The repository under development will be cloned
1. A `Dockerfile` will be automatically generated for the specified `python` and `debian` version.
1. After that, the automatic build of the `Docker image` will start
1. The `docker-compose.yml` file will be automatically generated
1. Configuration files will be generated for VS Code for the debugger to work correctly
1. `docker-compose up` will start automatically
1. All python dependencies will be installed in the virtual environment
1. Odoo will start with all specified addons for selected version

You can stop this running process by using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+C`.

After that, you can run odoo in developer mode:
```bash
python3 /path/to/cloned/odoo_dev_project/odpm.py -d test_db -i -u
```
This command will launch odoo inside the `Docker container` and create a new database named `test_db` and install the module from the specified project there

After that, you can open the address `http://127.0.0.1:8069` in the browser and you will see the login window.

2 configuration files are required for the system to work:
- `odpm.json` -  it also can be located in the repository with the developing project, contains the necessary information on how to start this project. If the file is not found, it will be created from the default values.
- `user_settings.json` - contains the settings and preferences of a specific developer. If the file is not found, it will be created from the default values.

## Short summary

This app build environment for your project. The project itself is a directory that is specified in a parameter `developing_project` of `user_settings.json` file or as key of `--init` param.

## Parameters in .env file:
The system will try to create a `.odpm` directory in the user's home directory of your operating system. Inside it the system will place the `.env` file. If you are launching the application for the first time, it will ask a question for each item described below in this file and offer default values. If you don't know what to answer, just press `Enter`. If you place the `.env` file in the project directory, the program will consider it a priority and try to take values from the file inside the project.
- `BACKUP_DIR` - the directory where the archives are located. It is used to specify the name of the database for recovery using command-line parameters and then the system will search for an archive with the specified name in this directory, or when saving the database to the archive, it will appear in this directory, can be used for all projects
- `ODOO_SRC_DIR` - The directory where the full clone of the repository of the `odoo` platform itself should be located. I usually put it in my user profile. It is used by all projects.
- `ODOO_PROJECTS_DIR` - create a directory where clones of all used repositories will be created. You just need specify the path to this directory, then the system itself will create this directory and clone all the repositories into it and arrange them so that there are no conflicts
- `PATH_TO_SSH_KEY` - if, for some reason, you are unable to add your repository key to the ssh agent, then you can specify the path to it here. At the moment, one key will be used for all repositories
- `ODOO_PORT` - the port on which odoo will be launched by default at the address 127.0.0.1
- `POSTGRES_PORT` - the port on which the PostgreSQL DBMS will be launched by default at the address 127.0.0.1
- `DEBUGGER_PORT` - the port on which the debugger will run by default at the address 127.0.0.1

Example for Linux:
```conf
BACKUP_DIR=/home/user/odoo_backups
ODOO_SRC_DIR=/home/user/odoo
ODOO_PROJECTS_DIR=/home/user/odoo_projects
PATH_TO_SSH_KEY=/home/user/.ssh/my_ssh_key
ODOO_PORT=8069
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
DEBUGGER_PORT=5678
```

## Command Line Interface parameters

- `--init` - initiate a project in the current directory. As a parameter, you can specify a link to the `git` repository
- `--branch` - used together with the `--init` parameter to specify the branch of the git repository to be cloned.
- `-d` - to specify the name of the database to work with. If there is no such database, it will be automatically created based on the `db_creation_data` parameter from the configuration file `user_settings.json`
- `-i` - the parameter indicates that the modules specified in the `init_modules` parameter of the `user_settings.json` configuration file should be initialized.
- `-u` - the parameter indicates that the modules specified in the `pdate_modules` parameter of the `user_settings.json` configuration file should be updated.
- `-t` - will run tests of modules specified in `init_modules` and `update_modules`, works only when using parameters `-d`, `-i`, `-u`. If the database is being created from scratch, tests of all installed modules will be run. This may take a long time.
- `--get-dbs-list` - will show list of databases
- `--db-restore` - The system will attempt to restore a database archive. Specify the archive name, which must be located in the directory specified by the `BACKUP_DIR` parameter in the `.env` file. The database name for restoration will be taken from the `-d` parameter.
- `--db-backup` - The system will attempt to create a database archive. You can specify the archive name to be created in the directory specified by the `BACKUP_DIR` parameter in the `.env` file. If no name is provided, it will be generated automatically based on the database name from the `-d` parameter plus a timestamp. The database name for archiving will be taken from the `-d` parameter.
- `--db-drop` - accept database name as parameter. Database with selected  name will be deleted. If you will use it with  params `-d`, `-i`, `-u`, and select the same name, system will with first step delete DB and with second step will create new DB with the same name, and will install selected modules.
- `--translate` - will update translation for selected language, for example `ru_RU` or `eu_US` for database from `-d` param and for modules form `update_modules` and `init_modules` from `user_settings.json` file
- `--pip-install` - will start install of all python packages from odoo `requirements.txt` and from `requirements_txt` param to environment inside `docker container`.
- `--start-precommit` - will start pre-commit for your project inside container, specified in parameter `developing_project` from file `user_settings.json`.
- `--build-image` - will build Docker image for your odoo version
- `--set-admin-pass` - when you specify the value of this parameter, the administrator account will have its password and login changed to those specified in the `db_default_admin_login` and `db_default_admin_password` parameters in the `user_settings.json` configuration file. Be sure to specify the name of the database for which you want to change the password and use the `-d database_name` parameter.
- `--sql-execute` - wen this parameter is used, the SQL scripts specified in the `sql_queries` parameter of the `user_settings.json` configuration file will be executed. Each script is a separate string that is an element of the list. You must specify the name of the database for which you want to change the password and use the parameter `-d database_name`.
